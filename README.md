# PowerBoard-Test-PCB
This circuit's goal is first, provide safety checks on the voltage and current of a 12V battery and second output 3V3, 5V and 12V. The current check is done through 20A fuse in a 25A fuse holder. The voltage range is set by two potentiometers and checked by two opamps. If condition is met, the mosfet turns on. Next, the relay is activated and the voltage goes through two buck converters (3V3, 5V). 
It is test board, thus as I learn more and perform tests on the board, revisions will be made as I go through.
